 **Navigation**                                                                           
  \- Previous / Next buttons to step through comics sequentially                                                 
  \- Jump to a specific comic number directly                                                           
                                                                                 
  **Discovery**                                                                           
  \- "Explain this comic" — link or button that opens explainxkcd.com for the current comic                                    
  \- Favorites / bookmarks — save comics locally to revisit                                                    

  **Display**                                                                            
  \- Pinch-to-zoom on the image (especially useful for text-heavy comics)                                             
  \- Show the comic title (the title field from the API) — currently only the alt text is shown                                  
  \- Dark mode support 

  **Sharing** 
  \- Share sheet (native OS share) instead of just copying the link 

  **UX** **polish** 
  \- Loading spinner while the image loads (not just while fetching metadata) 
  \- Error handling if the network request fails 
  \- Offline support / caching so previously viewed comics load without internet 

  The most impactful ones for everyday use are probably **Previous/Next** **navigation**, **pinch-to-zoom**, and **showing** **the** **comic** **title**. Any of those appeal to you?
